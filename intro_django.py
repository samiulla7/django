Why Django?
Django is a Web framework written in Python. 
A Web framework is a software that supports the development of dynamic Web sites, 
applications, and services. 
It provides a set of tools and functionalities that solves many common problems 
associated with Web development, such as security features, database access, sessions, 
template processing, URL routing, internationalization, localization, and much more.

Using a Web framework, such as Django, enables us to develop secure and reliable Web applications 
very quickly in a standardized way, without having to reinvent the wheel.


Who’s Using Django?
It’s good to know who is using Django out there, so to have an idea what you can do with it.
 Among the biggest Web sites using Django we have:
 Instagram, Disqus, Mozilla, Bitbucket, Last.fm, National Geographic.


Installation
The first thing we need to do is install some programs on our machine 
so to be able to start playing with Django.
The basic setup consists of installing Python, Virtualenv, and Django.

Using virtual environments is not mandatory, but it’s highly recommended.
If you are just getting started, it’s better to start with the right foot.

When developing Web sites or Web projects with Django, 
it’s very common to have to install external libraries to support the development. 
Using virtual environments, each project you develop will have its isolated environment. 
So the dependencies won’t clash. It also allows you to maintain in 
your local machine projects that run on different Django versions.
